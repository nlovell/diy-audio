This repository is a way of me documenting my various audio-related projects. 

## Drive Link

I've included a few of my favourite photos in this repo, but the bulk of the images are stored in Google Drive.

Anyway Github isn't really suited for hosting images, so here's a Google Drive link for full photo albums:

## Cables

I've been making a few - these are hand-braided cables made primarily from Van Damme cable and paracord sleeving.

### Braided Cables

## IEM Repairs and Modifications

Here's a section where I do dumb things to tiny electronics.

### MMCX Songbirds

The Hifiman RE-600 are notorious for having a bad cable. I fixed this by replacing it with an MMCX connector.
