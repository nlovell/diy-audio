# DIY Audio

This repository is a way of me documenting my various audio-related projects. I've included a few of my favourite photos in this repo, but the bulk of the images are stored in Google Drive - refer to that for more details.

## Custom Cables

I've been making a few - these are hand-braided cables made primarily from Van Damme cable and paracord sleeving.

## IEM Repairs

The Hifiman RE-600 are notorious for having a bad cable. I fixed this by replacing it with an MMCX connector.
