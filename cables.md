## About Me

I'm Alan, I'm a 21 year old university student. I've been tinkering with electrical projects for as long as I can remember, and have been soldering for over 10 years now. I've always had an interest in audio equipment, but visiting a HeadFi event in 2018 really sparked a passion for me. Since then, I've accumulated a few high-end and midrange headphones and have gotten stuck in with modding, repairing, and otherwise tinkering with portable audio equipment.

The audio game is already prohibitively expensive -  I'd rather keep things low-price and high-quality so the everyday audiophile can have a cable they love the look and feel of, rather than cater to those with more money than sense. So in 2020, I decided to make a cost-effective solution for those who want custom cables.

All my cables are hand-made in the UK, using legitimate quality parts sourced from UK and EU-based suppliers wherever possible.

## Cables

Right, here's the meat-and-potatoes of this page. _Cables_. The main difference between the series is the specific conductor used.

My pricing structure is simple; A basic cost-per-metre for braided cables, plus the cost of connectors (which vary significantly).

| Series                    |Cost per Metre|
|---------------------------|--------------|
| [Ika](#ika-series)        | £12.00       |
| [Kiore](#kiore-series)    | £15.50       |
| [Manu](#manu-series)      | £12.00       |
| [Tumuku](#tumuku-series)  | £18.50       |

I can ship internationally, and can provide quotes but if you want to figure out an estimate feel free to do so [here](https://www.royalmail.com/price-finder).

I currently use Cardas Audio Quad Eutectic Solder when making my cables, if anyone cares. It's a blend of silver, copper, tin, and lead according to the [Cardas Audio website](http://www.cardas.com/solder.php).

All of my Y-splitting cables utilise a custom aluminium-shell Y-split.

### Ika Series

Ika are the entry-level cables made here. They're a harder-wearing and last a long time.

_Conductor material:_ Pure copper twisted with silver-plated strands.

| Specs for nerds    |                   |
|--------------------|-------------------|
|Conductors          | 7x  .08mm SPC OFC |
|                    | 32x .08mm OFC     |
|Insulation          | XLPCE             |
|Resistance          | .093 Ω/m          |
|Unsleeved core size | 1.6mm             |
|Sleeved core size   | 1.9mm             |

### Kiore Series

Kiore are a step-up from the Ika, but still firmly in the "affordable" range of prices.

_Conductor material:_ Pure copper.

| Specs for nerds    |                |
|--------------------|----------------|
|Conductors          | 20x .12mm OFC  |
|Insulation          | XLCPE          |
|Resistance          | .083Ω/m        |
|Unsleeved core size |                |
|Sleeved core size   |                |

### Manu Series

Manu is a side-step on the Kiore series. It's not much different in price, but it's a bit heavier cable.

Cables made using Manu may not be as flexible as Kiore or Ika due to Manu cables using a thicker gauge than the other two, so this option may not be suitable for all use-cases.

_Conductor material:_ Pure copper.

| Specs for nerds    |                |
|--------------------|----------------|
|Conductors          | 30x .25mm OFC  |
|Insulation          | XLCPE          |
|Resistance          | .013Ω/m        |
|Unsleeved core size | 2.3mm          |
|Sleeved core size   | 2.6mm          |

### Tumuku Series

Tumuku is a fine braid stranded SCP copper, all made and assembled in England. PTFE insulation makes it softer than XLCPE, so this wire is better suited for IEMs. Available in various colours (unsleeved).

_Conductor material:_ Silver-plated copper.

| Specs for nerds    |                |
|--------------------|----------------|
|Conductors          | 19x .15mm SPC  |
|Insulation          | PTFE (Teflon)  |
|Resistance          | .058Ω/m        |
|Sleeved core size   |                |
|Unsleeved core size | 1.1mm          |

## Returns and Warranty

I may just be a guy doing this for fun, but it doesn't mean I'm a monster.

### Returns

My cables are made bespoke to your specifications. As such, returns *may* be accepted subject to fees approximately equivalent to the cost of the connectors + 10%. This cost will vary by cable, as if you no longer want it, I'll either have to absorb the cost of material personally or find another buyer.

As the cost will vary, please ask about the returns related to your specific configuration.

### Warranty

I will honour a 12 month warranty on any of my analogue cables, from the date provided on your certificate of authenticity.
Outside of this period, I will be willing to repair cables for a small fee.

## FAQ

_What can you make?_

Anything you want! I primarily deal with 4 and 3-core braids, but I can go higher, and can work with almost any kind of connectors. _USB?_ Done. _Mini-XLR?_ Cool. _Full-size XLR?_ Easy. _DMX?_ Yep.  
If you're willing to pay for the connectors, I'm willing to make cables for them.

_How many have you made?_

Enough. I've soldered several dozen cables, and have been building a portfolio of my braided cable works since 2020. Said gallery can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TaY7_JfRnlylWYvRs6gfiyFJBXne6QWk). Inside you'll find examples of braiding, finished cables, and close-up photos of my soldering work.

_What material do you use?_

I personally focus on price:performance, so my conductor and connector choices are usually what people would call "midrange". Refer to the _Specs for Nerds_ tables relating to specific [cables](#cables) for more details. But if you're willing to pay for more expensive materials, I'm more than happy to work with them.
