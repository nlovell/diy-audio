## About Me

I'm Alan, I'm a 21 year old university student. I've been tinkering with electrical projects for as long as I can remember, and have been soldering for over 10 years now. I've always had an interest in audio equipment, but visiting a HeadFi event in 2018 really sparked a passion for me. Since then, I've accumulated a few high-end and midrange headphones and have gotten stuck in with modding, repairing, and otherwise tinkering with portable audio equipment.

In 2020, I decided to make a cost-effective solution for those who want custom cables.

All my cables are hand-made in the UK, using legitimate quality parts sourced from UK and EU-based suppliers wherever possible.

## Cables

Right, here's the meat-and-potatoes of this page. _Cables_. All of my cables utilise a custom aluminium-shell Y-split, and the main difference between the series is the specific conductor used.=

My pricing structure is simple; A basic cost-per-metre for braided cables, plus the cost of connectors (which vary significantly).

|Series|Cost per Metre|
|-|-|
|[Ika](#ika-series)|£10|
|[Kiore](#kiore-series)|£15|

|Connector|Brand|Cost|
|-|-|-|

I can ship internationally, and can provide quotes but if you want to figure out an estimate feel free to do so [here](https://www.royalmail.com/price-finder).

### Ika Series

Ika are the entry-level cables made here. They're slightly stiffer than the Kiore, but should be harder-wearing and last a long time.

### Kiore Series

Kiore are the mid-tier cables, and are more supple and flexible than the Ika series.

## Returns and Warranty

I may just be a guy doing this for fun, but it doesn't mean I'm a monster.

### Returns

My cables are made bespoke to your specifications. As such, returns may be accepted subject to fees approximately equivalent to the cost of the connectors + 10%. This cost will vary by cable, as if you no longer want it, I'll either have to absorb the cost of material personally or find another buyer.

### Warranty

I will honour a 42-day warranty on the soldering in any of my cables, as determined by the date provided on your certificate of authenticity. If a cable goes faulty (not through misuse or damage) I will cover the cost of returning the cable to you, but if there are obvious signs of damage I will ask the buying to cover postage both ways.

I will be willing to repair cables outside of that timeframe, but not for free.

## FAQ

_What can you make?_
Anything you want! I primarily deal with 4 and 3-core braids, but I can go higher, and can work with almost any kind of connectors. _USB?_ Done. _Mini-XLR?_ Cool. _Full-size XLR?_ Easy. _DMX?_ Yep.  
If you're willing to pay for the connectors, I'm willing to make cables for them.

_How many have you made?_
Enough. I've soldered several dozen cables, and have been building a portfolio of my braided cable works since 2020. Said gallery can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TaY7_JfRnlylWYvRs6gfiyFJBXne6QWk). Inside you'll find examples of braiding, finished cables, and my soldering work.

_What material do you use?_
I personally focus on price:performance, so my conductor and connector choices are usually what people would call "midrange". But if you're willing to pay for more expensive materials, I'm more than happy to work with them.

_Why 42 day warranty?_
I'm going with 30 days + 12 days to account for most worldwide shipping. If for some reason your cable takes a long time to arrive, I can be flexible. Again, I'm just a single guy - just shoot me an [email](mailto:cables@nlovell.net) if you want to resolve any issues with your cable.
